# PSO_in-Machine-Learning


particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It solves a problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed particles, and moving these particles around in the search-space according to simple mathematical formulae over the particle's position and velocity. Each particle's movement is influenced by its local best known position, but is also guided toward the best known positions in the search-space, which are updated as better positions are found by other particles. This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions.

The following are  some of the terms related to PSO:-

Population: set of candidate solutions tested in one time step, consists of m
particles (e.g., m = 20)
• Particle: represents a candidate solution; it is characterized by a velocity
vector
v and a position vector x in the hyperspace of dimension D
• Evaluation span: evaluation period of each candidate solution during one a
time step; as in GA the evaluation span might take more or less time
depending on the experimental scenario.
• Fitness function: measurement of efficacy of a given candidate solution
during the evaluation span
